# PyBer_Analysis

Focusing on ride share data over different cities, varying costs, and city types (suburb vs rural vs urban), this analysis expands understanding of how this business is growing in different environments.  The main feature of this analysis is an understanding of city type and how they correspond to different scenarios.  Technically, this leads to a strong understanding of Pandas and Matplotlib for making strong graphical representaiton.  Even an added understanding of date and date-processing are required in order to make a satisfying analysis overall.

We can see from the weekly information inside the table that urban is close to twice the fares of suburban which can be three times larger than rurual - the smallest profit margin by far.  This is confirmed by the Total Fare graph (multi-line) where blue urban is the highest and gold rural is the lowest.  From the graph, we can see that there is no overlap from city-type in any month.  The graph also makes it clear that January appears to show fewer fares wheras approaching May results in better business.  For some unknown reason, there also appears to be a spike in data just before March but without more data, this could merely be a coincidence.

One can clearly see that there are far fewer rides in the rural area corresponding to significantly fewer drivers.  Price is higher of course due to further travel distance however one must acknowledge that the population density is much thinner when out in the country.  It would make sense to increase the amount of business in the winter months by improving the abilities of drivers to move around in the urban and suburban environments.  Given the fact that urban and suburban profits were overall higher in May than in January, it makes sense to increase marketing efforts to ensure more residents are aware of the service in the near future.  This should ensure consistent profit increases.
